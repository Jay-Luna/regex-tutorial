# Validating a Phone Number

/^\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}$/

## Summary

A phone number regex, also known as a regular expression, is a pattern used to validate and match phone numbers in a specific format. It ensures that phone numbers adhere to the expected structure and formatting. Applying the regex pattern to a given phone number helps determine if it is valid or not. This helps maintain data accuracy, improves user experience, and enables reliable handling of phone number inputs in applications. In this example, we will be focusing on a basic format for North American phone numbers.

The regex we will be discussing is meant to match phone numbers in the following formats:

XXX-XXX-XXXX
